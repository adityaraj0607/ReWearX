      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Items collection  
    match /items/{itemId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow create: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.uploadedBy;
      allow update: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Swap requests
    match /swapRequests/{requestId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    
    // Redemptions
    match /redemptions/{redemptionId} {

service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    match /images/{userId}/{allPaths=**} {
      allow read: if true;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId
        && request.resource.size < 2 * 1024 * 1024
        && request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*');
    }
  }
}
